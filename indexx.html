                    <P>Food is not simply stuff that people eat when their hungry. Food is awesome, delicious, inventive, colorful, inspiring, and so much more. A mutual love of food can bring different people together.</P>

                <p>Thanksgiving meal, treating a friend to a birthday dinner, or annual family celebrations are perfect ways to keep in touch and connect with your family and friends that you might not see regularly. If a distant relative or family friend I hadn't seen in a while was in Boston and offered to take me out to dinner to 'catch up', you bet I would take them up on the offer. Food is a wonderful thing that can bring people together and can help you keep the ones you love close.</p>
